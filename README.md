# CompreFlow 🛒

A modern Retail Execution + Pricing Intelligence + Sales Intelligence platform built with React.js, React Native and NestJS is a multi-tenant B2B SaaS solution built for companies that need to centralize, automate, and scale their operations with security, reliability, and high performance. Inspired by enterprise-grade infrastructures, the platform delivers a complete ecosystem for business management, operational monitoring, and real-time strategic insights.

The solution enables employees to register purchases, sales, and operational activities directly through the mobile application, instantly sending all data to the management dashboard. This provides business leaders with a unified, real-time view of operations, performance metrics, and company activities from anywhere.

Built with a modern and scalable architecture, the platform supports multiple companies within a single environment while maintaining complete data isolation and security for each client. In addition, it offers intelligent dashboards, customizable reports, user and permission management, operational auditing, inventory management, product control, and sales tracking — creating a complete infrastructure for companies looking to digitize processes and improve operational efficiency.
